# Thonny Python
This is my first python programming project on Raspberry Pi using Raspian OS. Additionally, this is my first project covering Git through Raspian OS. 

## Raspberry Pi 4 Set Up
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 1.5GHz 64-bit quad-core ARMv8 CPU 2 GB RAM
- USB-C Power Supply (5-foot cable)
- Raspberry Pi White/Red Case
- Raspberry Pi Keyboard and Mouse
- Micro HDMI to HDMI Cable (3-foot cable)
- 16 GB MicroSD Card w/NOOBS

## Challenges for GitHub Setup
- Set up git authentication using token. 
- Permanently authenticating with Git repositories

## Challenges completed for Python Program
- Print **Hello World!**
- Completed looping:
  - Identified colon symbol is used to tell Python that the next instruction shuold be part of the loop.
  - Identified that indentation is how Python tells the difference between instruction outside the loop and instructions inside the loop; the indented code is known as being nested. 
    - Indentation is important in Python and one of the most common bug in Python (be aware!)
